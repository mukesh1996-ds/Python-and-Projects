"""
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and 
powerful capabilities. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design 
philosophy emphasizes code readability and a clear syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners 
and experienced developers alike.

Key Features of Python:

Simple and Readable: Python code is easy to read and write due to its clean and straightforward syntax, 
making it a great language for beginners.

Interpreted: Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed line-by-line by the 
Python interpreter, eliminating the need for compilation before running.

High-level: Python abstracts away low-level details, allowing programmers to focus on problem-solving rather 
than managing system resources.

Dynamic Typing: Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. 
The interpreter infers the variable type based on the assigned value.

Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a vast standard library that provides numerous modules and 
packages, offering functionalities for various tasks, such as file I/O, network communication, and more.

Community and Ecosystem: Python has a large and active community of developers, which leads to a rich 
ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks that can be easily integrated into your projects.

Cross-platform: Python is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and 
different Linux distributions.

Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, 
allowing you to create and work with classes and objects.

Versatility: Python is widely used in various domains, such as web development, data science, 
machine learning, scientific computing, automation, and more.
